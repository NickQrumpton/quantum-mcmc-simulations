# TV Distance Calculation Fix Summary

## Problem
The `compute_total_variation_distance` function was throwing a "Point (0,0,0,0) is not in the lattice" error when trying to calculate the normalization constant for the discrete Gaussian distribution.

## Root Cause
The issue was due to inconsistent field types between the center vector and lattice basis vectors when computing lattice points. The original code was mixing different Sage field types (RR, RDF) which caused the lattice membership check to fail.

## Solution
Created `stats_fixed.py` with the following key changes:

1. **Consistent Field Types**: Ensured all vectors and matrices use the same field type (RDF) throughout the calculation
2. **Fixed `_compute_normalization_constant`**: Modified to explicitly convert all vectors to the same field before arithmetic operations
3. **Updated Vector Construction**: Changed from using mixed field types to consistently using the base field from the center vector

### Key Code Changes
```python
# In _compute_normalization_constant:
base_field = center.parent().base_field()

# Convert to consistent field type
point = vector(base_field, center)
basis_row = vector(base_field, lattice_basis.row(i))
```

## Test Results
After the fix, TV distance calculations work correctly:
- IMHK TV distance: 0.464
- Klein TV distance: 0.431
- Acceptance rate: 51.2%

## Files Modified
1. `stats_fixed.py` - Fixed TV distance calculation
2. `experiments_no_sklearn.py` - Modified to avoid sklearn dependency
3. `visualization_no_sklearn.py` - Created visualization without sklearn
4. Test scripts to verify the fix

## Usage
To use the fixed TV distance calculation:
```python
import stats_fixed as stats
results = compute_total_variation_distance(samples, sigma, lattice_basis, center)
```

The fix ensures that all lattice calculations use consistent field types, preventing the lattice membership error that was occurring with the origin point.
