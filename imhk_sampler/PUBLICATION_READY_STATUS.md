# IMHK Sampler Publication-Ready Status

## Status: ✅ READY FOR PUBLICATION

As of 2025-05-18, the IMHK sampler package has been fully verified and is ready for publication-quality experiments.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Import Errors Fixed ✅
- Fixed ImportError in test_parameter_config.py and test_samplers.py
- Ensured create_lattice_basis is correctly placed in utils.py
- Updated all tests to import from the correct module
- Resolved circular import issues in experiments package

### 2. Package Structure Improvements ✅
- Implemented relative imports throughout the package
- Created proper __init__.py files for all modules
- Fixed experiments/__init__.py imports
- Organized code to follow Python best practices

### 3. Testing and Verification ✅
- Created verify_imports.py script for comprehensive import testing
- All 23 tests pass successfully
- No import errors or circular dependencies
- Smoke test completed successfully

### 4. Publication-Quality Features ✅
- Added debug logging throughout sampler modules
- Fixed TV distance calculation issue
- Generated diagnostic reports
- Implemented proper error handling

### 5. Final Verification ✅
- Ran comprehensive smoke test on 2025-05-18
- Tested all basis types: identity, skewed, ill-conditioned
- Tested multiple ratios: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0
- All experiments completed without errors
- Results and plots generated successfully

## Key Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 23/23 tests passing
- **Import Verification**: All modules import correctly
- **Smoke Test**: Completed successfully with all parameter combinations
- **TV Distance**: Correctly computing normalization constants
- **ESS Calculation**: Working correctly for all test cases

## Ready for:
- Publication-quality experiments
- Parameter sweep studies
- Convergence analysis
- Baseline comparisons
- Performance benchmarking

## Next Steps (Optional):
1. Run full parameter sweep experiments
2. Generate publication figures
3. Conduct scalability analysis
4. Compare with other sampling methods
