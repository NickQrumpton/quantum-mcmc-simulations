# Quantum MCMC Simulations

This repository contains classical and quantum algorithm implementations for sampling from discrete Gaussian distributions over lattices, with a focus on testing quantum-enhanced MCMC methods.

## Structure

- `classical_sampler/`: Classical methods like IMHK, Kleinâ€™s algorithm
- `quantum_sampler/`: Quantum-inspired or quantum-enhanced MCMC samplers
- `results/`: Plots and logs from experiments
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages required to run the project
